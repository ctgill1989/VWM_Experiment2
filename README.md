# VWM_Experiment2
Gaze-contingent visual working memory experiment with integrated eye tracking and stimulus control (MATLAB/Psychtoolbox).

This version of the experiment is shared as-is for demonstration purposes and reflects internal research code. It is not a distribution-ready software package. File paths, triggers, and experiment-specific settings may require adjustment to run in other environments.
